## 📌 Project Overview

This project utilizes the **Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset** to perform an end-to-end data science analysis. The dataset includes real e-commerce orders made at Olist Store from 2016 to 2018 and provides insights into customer behavior, product trends, delivery logistics, payment methods, and customer reviews.

The main goal is to apply foundational data science techniques to derive actionable insights, build predictive models, and demonstrate how data can support business decisions in the e-commerce sector.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple relational CSV files including:

- `orders.csv`
- `order_items.csv`
- `order_reviews.csv`
- `order_payments.csv`
- `customers.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `sellers.csv`
- `geolocation.csv`

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
